## Summary: Fine-Tuning a Low-Resource Translation Model: English-Irish

This summary outlines the key areas of investigation for understanding the landscape of fine-tuning low-resource translation models, specifically for English-Irish. The research focuses on identifying user search patterns, key questions, related keywords, and the overall market context.

**Main Themes and Topics:**

*   **Low-Resource Neural Machine Translation (NMT):** The core challenge of translating between languages with limited parallel data.
*   **Fine-Tuning Techniques:** Exploring methods to adapt pre-trained models to the English-Irish language pair.
*   **Data Augmentation:** Investigating techniques to artificially increase the size of the training dataset.
*   **Domain Adaptation:** Addressing the challenge of adapting models trained on general data to specific domains.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:** Identifying appropriate metrics for evaluating the performance of low-resource NMT models.
*   **Available Resources:** Discovering existing datasets, pre-trained models, and community knowledge.

**Key Insights and Patterns (Expected):**

*   **Data Scarcity:** The primary challenge is the limited availability of parallel English-Irish data.
*   **Transfer Learning:** Leveraging pre-trained multilingual models or models trained on related languages is crucial.
*   **Back-Translation and Synthetic Data:** These data augmentation techniques are likely to be important for improving performance.
*   **Domain Specificity:** Performance may vary significantly depending on the domain of the text.
*   **Evaluation Challenges:** Standard MT metrics may not accurately reflect the quality of low-resource translations.
